      <h1>RBP</h1>
      <p>
        Participating in Dickinson College is one of the most important
        benchmarks in my life, not just in academics but also in how I open my
        worldview, explore opportunities, and see different aspects of life that
        I have never thought of. And one of the crucial impacts that had on me
        was when I chose my major. My first intention when choosing a major even
        before attending college was not computer science; in fact, I have no
        interest in studying technology and how it works. It can be said that I
        have a minimum knowledge of computers and no experience with coding at
        all; I didn’t even know how to print “Hello World!” at that time. At
        that time, my dream is to become an inventor. My dream is to invent
        something that people have never thought of or been able to do before,
        more precisely. And that is why I’m interested in physics and
        mathematics at a very early age, and my first intention in my first year
        at Dickinson is to declare my major in physics. But things did not go
        the way that I expected. As always, at Dickinson, I am able to explore a
        wide range of subjects, even the subjects that I thought I was not
        interested in, and it was at this time that I listened to a friend of
        mine, an advisor staff member at Dickinson, enroll in COMP-130, the
        introduction to computing. This is the first course about programming
        that I’ve ever taken. With the help of my friends and the professor,
        they showed me what a computer could do at both low and high levels, how
        every place I go or interact with has the presence of a computer, my
        friend also shows me how to hack a solution for my test online. After
        that, I was fascinated by what computers could and had done to our
        lives. I see everything at deeper levels, trying to connect everything
        together and see how it makes sense. Computer science for me is like
        math and physics at higher levels; we combine theory and numbers in math
        with physics to build and solve problems using computers, and that is
        why I decided to change my path and declare my major in computer science
        in my sophomore year. At first, it seemed like I had given up my dream
        when I was a little boy and changed to something I'd only known for a
        few months, but that is not the case. My goal with computer science is
        still to create something—a web page, a robot, a system, etc. Or even a
        new theory, writing a paper about new technologies, so after all, my
        dream does not completely change at all; it just changes from one form
        to another.

      <h1>How Computer Science Major at Dickinson have effect on me</h1>
      <p>
        As someone who has zero experience with computers and programming like
        me, professors at the Computer Science department have done a great job
        of scheduling the courses and giving out what they need for students to
        understand the materials. One of the most important courses for me is
        COMP-256, where we learn about the abstraction of computers at a high
        level, which gives me a brief description of how every component in a
        computer is connected to each other, how people use electricity to
        convert it to 1 and 0, and what computers can do with just 1 and 0.
        Besides that, it shows me how everything I search on Google comes to me:
        how web pages work, what the operating system is, what networking does
        inside my computer, etc. One course that I feel is very important if I
        want to achieve a higher degree is COMP-314, where I learn about the
        theory of computing, which helps me discover and explore aspects of
        computers that I’ve struggled with before, like whether computers have
        limitations, how fast they can reach if we have infinite resources, etc.
        Even though I find it not necessarily popular in industrial environments
        for software engineers, I still think it is very important to know the
        theory behind everything to understand exactly what they do. For
        software engineers specifically, after about 2 years, I don’t know what
        exactly data structures and algorithms mean. I had never done any
        Leetcode or competitive programming problems before until my first OA
        interview for an internship, and I messed it up. I found it very
        difficult to solve even an easy problem with DSA, and I don’t even know
        how to make it fast or what to do to optimize. But after Data Structure
        and Algorithm courses, I’ve become more confident in solving those
        problems. I can understand how the way I write my code can make a
        computer take too long or take up a lot of space. But one of the nicest
        things about studying at the Computer Science Department at Dickinson is
        not about what information or knowledge the professors teach me; it is
        all about developing how to learn by myself and keep learning even when
        not in class. Each class helps me understand the basic idea of a topic,
        and that is the premise for me if I want to do deeper research on the
        topic. Reading scientific books about computer science was tricky for me
        at first, but with the right knowledge, I can now study by myself much
        easier than before.

        Studying at Dickinson Computer Science also helps me strengthen my
        coding skills, learn how to work with teammates, and most importantly,
        learn how to work on large projects. The Computer Science Seminar at
        Dickinson is very different from other schools that I know; it takes two
        semesters to complete, and we must contribute to an open-source project.
        At first, we were suggested to pick a “doable” project so we would not
        feel frightened and could actually contribute to the project. But
        somehow, I ended up with a project that is quite big for me, and most of
        the contributors to this project are people at the company who own the
        project and contribute to it. It seems very hard at first glance. At
        first, I felt very worried and frightened because I could not find a
        single bug ticket, I was able to contribute to. I also did not know how
        to understand the code base as it contained hundreds of files with
        different components for different parts. I was about to give up on this
        project and try to join another team or change to a more digestible
        project. But after considering for a while, I decided to stick with this
        project for many reasons, but the main one is that I do not want to give
        up this easily, as I thought I would just give up in the future if I met
        a difficult task. And that pushed me to do a lot of reading,
        investigate, look at code bases, and seek assistance from online forums
        from people I did not know. After a few weeks, I’ve got my first ticket
        merge, and that really created momentum for me to keep contributing to
        this project. I can clearly see my skills improving significantly; I
        understand how to look up which part of the project to get what I need,
        how to understand the codebase, how to read the right document, and most
        importantly, I am able to see the whole picture and break it down into
        small functions, but I still understand how everything works together.
      </p>
      <br />

        Choosing a specific field in computer science is also an important part
        of every CS major. At first, I thought computer science was just about
        learning how to code and make computers run, but there is so much more.
        Computer science is a very broad field that involves both theoretical
        and practical applications. People can choose to focus on many big
        fields like data science, machine learning, cybersecurity, software
        engineering, robotics, the theory of computation, artificial
        intelligence, and so much more. There is one important thing that I
        learned: people tend to respect someone who is excellent in one field
        rather than someone who knows a little bit about everything. That is why
        finding out what you truly like and focusing on that is very important,
        not just in computer science but in every other field. I was at first
        struggling to find what I liked because computers are so new to me, and
        everything seems very interesting. That is why it is very difficult for
        me to focus on one thing. After exploring, having experienced a lot of
        different fields, and participating in many different courses that the
        department offered, it was not until my seminar that I became interested
        in computer networks and distributed systems. Because the project that
        I’ve been working on is very much about distributed systems, I have to
        do a lot of research and read about system design and architecture,
        which makes me feel intrigued to learn more about it. This technology
        has a lot of potential and impact on the world, as it helps improve the
        performance of the system. This helps me identify the career and
        academic path that I want to focus on, and if possible, I would like to
        someday do serious research about distributed systems and networks in
        the near future.

      <h1>Conclusion</h1>
      <p>
        Participating in the Dickinson Computer Science program is one of the
        most important experiences I’ve had, as it not only helps me improve my
        technical skills and set up my computer science path but also helps me
        develop critical thinking skills to help me see the world in a way I’ve
        never thought of and, from that, accept and learn new ideas in a
        positive way.
